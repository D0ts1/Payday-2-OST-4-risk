# Payday 2 OST

This is a simple OST mod replacing risk of rains soundtrack with music from payday 2. This was made using the original soundtrack mod by Kyle.

## Other Info

This plugin uses NAudio.dll https://github.com/naudio/NAudio to help load and play music at runtime.
This is done to make it very easy for players to supply their own music. The downside is that the normal in game
music isn't disabled (Maybe there is a way to do that, I dunno). To get around this, this plugin sets your in game
music volume setting to 0. It tries to set it back to where it was when the game closes but I'm not sure if this works.
Anyway you have been warned.
