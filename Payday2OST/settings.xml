        Here is where you define what songs are used in which scenes and if they are
        "boss" music (played during teleporter events or not).

        *****  If you just want to play with RoR1 music, you just need to make sure  *****
        *****  your music filenames match EXACTLY with all name="" attributes below. *****

        Here is an example of a file that will play on the title screen and other main menus:

        <song
            name="01 Risk of Rain.mp3"
            scenes="title,lobby,logbook,crystalworld,eclipseworld"
            boss="false"
            volume="1"
        />

        "name" must match the file name exactly. Supported extensions are ".mp3" and ".wav" (case sensitive).

        "scenes" are the comma separated scene IDs (or levels) that will have a chance to play this music.
        See README.md for more info on scene IDs.

        "boss" is if this music plays during a teleporter event or not (or during the final boss).
        It's important to understand that when boss is true, the music ONLY plays during teleporter events
        and when boss is false, the music ONLY plays when *NOT* during a teleporter event.

        If you want music to play regardless of the teleporter charging, you must make two <song> definitions
        with the same data but with one boss="true" and the other boss="false"

        "volume" is a local volume decimal (between 0 and 1) that gets multiplied with the global volume tag.

        You can have multiple <song> definitions with the same or similar data. If a scene matches multiple <song>'s
        then this plugin will choose one randomly. If NO matches are found, then the plugin will choose a random
        sound file it found in the plugin folder.
